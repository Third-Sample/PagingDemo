# PagingDemo
A simple implementation of paging library without Room. This App uses the GitHub api to search repositories. `PageKeyedDataSource` is used to page through the results.

 _Note: Too much scrolling can result in an `HTTP 403 Forbidden` error. This is caused due to GitHub api being rate limited._
